Download and install Git.
You can download the latest version of Git from the official Git website.

To set your username and email, use the following commands:

                commands
git config --global user.name "YOUR-NAME"
git config --global user.email "YOUR-EMAIL"

Replace YOUR-NAME with your actual name and YOUR-EMAIL with your actual email address.

And that's it! You've successfully set up Git on your computer.
You can now use Git to manage your code and track changes to your projects.
