However, once you've created a repository on GitHub and set up Git on your computer .
you can use Git to clone it to your local machine and work with it there.

Open a terminal or command prompt window.

Navigate to the directory where you want to store the cloned repository using the cd command.

Type the following command to clone the repository:
                
                commands
git clone REPOSITORY-URL

Replace REPOSITORY-URL with the URL of the repository you want to clone.

The repository will be cloned to a directory with the same name as the repository.
 To navigate into the cloned repository, use the following command:

cd REPOSITORY-NAME
Replace REPOSITORY-NAME with the name of the repository you just cloned.

And that's it! You've successfully cloned the repository to your computer. 
You can now use Git commands to manage the repository, make changes.
